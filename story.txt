Silas was deep in the woods when the the fog began rolling in.  Any assurance that he was on the right path was now obscured by the misty haze that surrounded him.  His body ached, his legs were tired from walking, and the weight of his pack was digging deep into his shoulders.  He desperately wanted to sto and take a rest, but time was not on his side.  He wasn't completely lost yet, but it was clear that he was a long way from finding a path out.

He had set out on this hiking trip bright and optimistic, but after days of trudging through the foggy woods of the Everglades, he honestly wished he had stayed home. The Everglades were supposed to be a supreme example of the beauty of the world in its natural order, but his mud-caked shoes and the scab from removing a  splinter in his left palm decidedly disagreed.

Luckily he had found a clearing in the trees before the sun was completely below the horizon.  He felt a slight sense of relief as he recognized how to get home.  As he walked through the front door of his house and dropped his bag on the ground his mother asked him "Did you have a good time at school today?", and after a long exaggerated sigh, Silas responded with an emphatic "NO!"

His mother started to ask him about it but Silas was not interested in talking to her. He just wanted to go into his room and sleep for a couple of hours. However, he started feeling angry for screaming at his mother.
